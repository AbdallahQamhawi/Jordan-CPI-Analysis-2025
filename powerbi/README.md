Power BI Report
Overview

This folder contains the Power BI report developed for the Jordan Consumer Price Index (CPI) Analysis 2025 project.

The report serves as the analytical and storytelling layer of the project, built on top of a structured data warehouse populated using Python and SQL. It focuses on explaining inflation trends, identifying key category drivers, and distinguishing between essential and non-essential cost pressures.

File Contents

CPI_jo_2026.pbix
The main Power BI report file containing all data models, measures, visuals, and dashboard pages.

Data Source

The Power BI report connects to processed CPI data generated during the ETL phase of the project.

Source
Department of Statistics (DOS), Jordan

Data Flow
Raw CPI data was ingested and cleaned using Python, modeled into fact and dimension tables using SQL, validated at the warehouse level, and then loaded into Power BI for analysis and visualization.

Data Model

The report follows a star schema design:

Fact Table
fact_cpi
Contains CPI index values, relative weights, and contribution measures by category and month.

Dimension Tables
dim_date
Time dimension with monthly granularity
dim_category
Hierarchical category structure including main and sub-categories, with essential and non-essential classification

Relationships
One-to-many relationships from dimension tables to the fact table
Single direction filtering from dimensions to fact to avoid ambiguity

Report Pages
Overview

Provides a high-level summary of inflation performance in 2025, including:

Headline CPI
Month over Month CPI change
Year to Date CPI growth
Top contributing category
Headline inflation trend over time
Largest rising and falling inflation drivers

This page answers the question:
What is happening to inflation overall?

Drivers Breakdown

Focuses on identifying which categories are driving inflation changes.

Key visuals include:

Waterfall chart showing inflation contribution by category
Treemap highlighting contribution concentration among top categories
Detailed contribution table with rankings
Scatter plot comparing category importance versus price level

This page answers the question:
Which categories are driving inflation and why?

Essentials

Analyzes inflation behavior for essential consumption categories.

Key insights include:

Top essential sub-categories by contribution share
Comparison between headline CPI and core essential CPI over time
Essential inflation gap highlighting divergence from overall inflation

An annotation is included to clarify that CPI contributions are influenced by both price changes and relative weights.

This page answers the question:
Are household necessities driving inflation pressure?

Filters and Interactivity

The report supports interactive exploration through:

Month selection using the month start date
Category hierarchy filtering
Essential versus non-essential analysis
Cross-highlighting between visuals

All visuals respond consistently to applied filters.

Refresh Notes

The report is built on static data for the year 2025.

To refresh the report with updated data:
